## `italyprog.zip`

This is an enhanced keyboard map for italian keyboards that adds two shortcuts for characters that are often sed in programming and on linux: tilda `~` and backtick `.

Those characters are mapped to AltGR + ' and AltGr + Ã¬, respectively.

**NOTE: this is only needed if you have a physical italian keyboard**

To install it, proceed as follows:

1. unzip
2. run the installer `setup.exe`
3. Go to Settings > Time & language > Language & region, then click on the dots beside your language (Italian), then under the section "keyboard" click on "Add a keyboard" and search for "Italian - Programmer keys"
4. optionally, remove the original italian keymap
